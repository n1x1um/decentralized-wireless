# MeshCore Tree Mount Installation

This document describes the design, build, and installation of the `e7her.nod3` MeshCore repeater mounting bracket. The deployment took place in Kanata, Ontario—a region with rugged, hilly terrain and dense vegetation. These natural conditions make reliable wireless communication challenging, as both elevation and line-of-sight are difficult to achieve. The required installation location introduced additional challenges: it sits at an elevation of −122 meters, for reference the nearby shores of the Ottawa River sit at approximately +134 meters. This installation was engineered to overcome those challenges by leveraging height from a tree-mounted structure.

A special thanks goes to **MrAlderson** for designing and building the MeshCore radio used in this project. His contribution provided a robust foundation for experimentation and reliable performance in difficult environments like this one.

# Mount Design

### Overview

The mounting system is constructed from PVC conduit and fittings. Each section has a specific role:

| Section | Name                | Purpose                                                                 |
|||-|
| #1      | **Mounting Arm**    | Attached directly to the tree trunk to anchor the system.               |
| #2      | **Maintenance Section** | Acts as a break point, allowing the radio to be serviced without detaching the main Mounting Arm. |
| #3      | **Extension Arm**   | Extends the solar panel and antenna past the tree canopy for clear exposure. |
| #4      | **Elbow**           | Redirects the conduit upwards for antenna placement and reduces conduit size. |
| #5      | **Elevation Arm**   | Extends the antenna as high as possible above the canopy.                |

**Total: $109 CAD**

### Build Notes

- **Expansion Coupling:** The PVC expansion coupling forms the main break point. This allows the Mounting Arm to be attached to the tree independently of the rest of the assembly, avoiding unnecessary weight during installation. A bolt locks the coupling in place to prevent both separation and rotation.
- **Joints:** Each pipe-to-fitting joint is cemented together with PVC glue, then reinforced with opposing screws for strength.
- **Mounting:** The radio and antenna are secured to the pole using pipe clamps, ensuring both stability and easy adjustment.

# Installation

The installation required raising the system to roughly **15 meters (50 feet)** above ground for optimal line-of-sight. The best option was a **20-meter-tall pine tree** near the deployment site. The tree was healthy, dense, and strong—providing the stability required.

### Process

- The tree was free-climbed to the mounting point (not a recommended method; see safety note below).
- At the installation height, climbing straps were attached at **two separate anchor points** to provide redundancy and stability.
- The **Mounting Arm** was lashed securely to the tree trunk, then reinforced with a single screw. Research suggested that a single screw causes less long-term harm to the tree compared to tightly clamped metal bands, which risk continuous bark damage.
- The **Extension Arm** rested on a sturdy branch, reducing sag and distributing weight. It was also lashed in place with paracord for stability.

### Safety Note

This description is not a safety guide. Free-climbing and improvised installations at height are inherently dangerous and should only be attempted with proper equipment and training. In standard practice, such work should be carried out using **fall-arrest gear** and professional climbing techniques.

### Improvement Note

The current design has a functional drawback: the **Maintenance Section (#2)** extends too far from the trunk, making servicing awkward. A future revision will move this section closer to the trunk for easier access.

# Results

The installation succeeded:

- The **solar panel** was oriented without obstruction.
- The **antenna** cleared the canopy and had optimal exposure for coverage.
- The **mount** was seated firmly in a natural opening within the branches, eliminating the need for trimming.
- Environmental impact was minimized by limiting bark damage and avoiding excessive cutting.

This design also reduced the time spent working at height, limiting risk while achieving a durable, stable, and serviceable installation.
